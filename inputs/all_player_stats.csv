153,Brodie,Grundy,RUC,,COL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2860,22,157,130,122,120.8,N/A,Grundy didn't have a massive start to the season but he did come home well after a slow start to the game. He gave away 5 free kicks and just the 55% efficiency rating from his 18 touches.,
748,Jack,Macrae,MID,,WBD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,2710,22,119,123.18,120.33,133.8,N/A,Macrae had the second best score for the Dogs from his 32 touches and 3 tackles. He also had a massive 15 clearances. His efficiency was down at 68% but owners can't be unhappy with a return of 132.,
464,Max,Gawn,RUC,,MEL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2696,21,212,128.38,143.33,139.4,N/A,Gawn was targeted by the Power players and his scoring suffered as a result. He managed to get himself to 87 but at his price tag we need him back over 110.,
77,Lachie,Neale,MID,,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Salt&VinegarCripps,,,owner,2668,22,190,121.27,126,119.8,N/A,Neale has had a great start to his Lions career and top scored for the Lions. His 29 touches included 14 contested but impressively he used the ball well with 86% efficiency.,
734,Josh,Dunkley,FWD,MID,WBD,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,2562,22,106,116.45,142.67,124.6,N/A,Dunkley didn't take any marks but he did lay 7 tackles and have 20 touches. He just missed the 100 so don't panic just yet if you are an owner.,
726,Marcus,Bontempelli,MID,,WBD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2524,22,140,114.73,109.67,125.4,N/A,Bontempelli showed us exactly why he has been a popular pick in previous seasons. 29 touches and 7 tackles including a goal was a great result which delivered owners 158 points. His role was a mix of midfield and forward time. Hopefully he can spend more time in the midfield to maintain high scores.,
178,Adam,Treloar,MID,,COL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Salt&VinegarCripps,,,owner,2495,22,99,113.41,114,128.4,N/A,Treloar had 34 touches and 6 tackles but 10 of those touches were clangers which kept his score down to just over 100. However he was the only Pie over 100 for the game. He will be a gun again this season.,
513,Todd,Goldstein,RUC,,NTH,N/A,N/A,N/A,Salt&VinegarCripps,,,owner,2469,22,69,112.23,122.67,123.6,N/A,Goldy was one of the top scoring rucks of the week with his 102 from 23 touches 34 hitouts and a goal. A great option for those that started with him.,
331,Patrick,Dangerfield,FWD,MID,GEE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2419,21,156,115.19,146.33,119,N/A,Danger seemed to spend most of his time in the midfield which is exactly what we were hoping for. 27 touches and a goal was good but 6 clangers and 59% efficiency was what held him back.,
485,Clayton,Oliver,MID,,MEL,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2406,22,109,109.36,99,106.8,N/A,Oliver was quiet as he only had one mark and two tackles. The Demons didn't have a great day and this could be why he was down. Hopefully he can turn this around next week.,
243,Nat,Fyfe,MID,,FRE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,2400,20,108,120,118,120.4,N/A,Fyfe was great with 10 kicks and 22 handballs. His 32 touches came at 78% efficiency and he had 10 clearances which was 3 more than any other player on the ground. He is worth putting on watch for next weeks trades.,
701,Jake,Lloyd,DEF,,SYD,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,2396,22,113,108.91,95.67,92,N/A,Lloyd was the only Swan over 100 and he got there in style from 35 touches at 85% and 10 marks. He is on his way to being one of the top defenders again.,
91,Dayne,Zorko,MID,,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2346,22,141,106.64,129,114.6,N/A,Zorko was great with his 20 touches and 8 tackles. This is a level of scoring we are hoping to continue to see from him. The Lions were good and hopefully their form continues and it allows him to score like this.,
94,Patrick,Cripps,MID,,CAR,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,2342,20,148,117.1,122.33,119.4,N/A,Cripps had the second best score for the Blues with 21 of his 32 touches contested and his efficiency was up at 81%. The only downside on his game was that 22 of those 32 touches were by hand.,
213,Zach,Merrett,MID,,ESS,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2324,22,78,105.64,99.33,99.8,N/A,Merrett didn't have a great game with just 16 touches one mark and 3 tackles. He is competing with an extra player (Shiel) in the midfield and this doesn't seem to be helping his scoring.,
712,Luke,Parker,MID,,SYD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,2312,22,141,105.09,94.67,88.8,N/A,N/A,
167,Scott,Pendlebury,MID,,COL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2295,22,115,104.32,114,108.4,N/A,N/A,
342,Tim,Kelly,FWD,MID,GEE,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2276,22,115,103.45,101.67,105.4,N/A,Kelly was fantastic and had the ball on a string in the first term. His 31 touches came at a 67% but 12 of those touches were contested. Look for him to be a popular trade in in the first few weeks.,
332,Mitch,Duncan,MID,,GEE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2271,22,79,103.23,87.33,89.8,N/A,N/A,
38,Rory,Sloane,MID,,ADE,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2266,22,106,103,87.33,90.8,N/A,Sloane returned to former glory scoring that we thought he could do. 9 tackles to go with his 36 touches which came at 76% and included 11 clearances! He will come into a few teams on the back of this performance.,
815,Elliot,Yeo,MID,,WCE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2260,21,93,107.62,110.67,114.8,N/A,Yeo didn't get the score that we need him to for his price. He was one of many Eagles that had a  down day. He did have 25 touches but he did have an efficiency of only 44%. Hopefully he can turn this around next week.,
548,Travis,Boak,FWD,,PTA,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2252,21,74,107.24,78,89.8,N/A,Boak has been reborn this year with 34 touches and a team high 5 clearances to get to his 119.,
405,Tim,Taranto,MID,,GWS,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2252,22,97,102.36,91.67,91.8,N/A,Taranto was talked about all through the preseason and he came up with the goods for us. 30 touches with 21 by foot and 10 tackles. The only blemish was that his efficiency was just under 50% which saw his score a little restricted.,
507,Ben,Cunnington,MID,,NTH,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,2245,22,46,102.05,87.67,82.8,N/A,N/A,
625,Dion,Prestia,MID,,RIC,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2229,22,116,101.32,115.67,121.2,N/A,N/A,
808,Luke,Shuey,MID,,WCE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2221,22,107,100.95,91.33,91.2,N/A,Shuey was one of just 3 Eagles over 100 this week. He had 26 touches and 23 were kicks which was great for us. He could have scored better as just 57% of those disposals were effective but it wasn't a great night for them so don't panic just yet.,
270,Michael,Walters,FWD,MID,FRE,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,2217,22,74,100.77,84.67,100.8,N/A,Walters had a great JLT with an 86 and 92. But are you game enough to select him? Last year he burnt us with suspensions and poor scoring.,
661,Rowan,Marshall,FWD,,STK,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2205,20,94,110.25,95.33,104,N/A,N/A,
316,Jarrod,Witts,RUC,,GCS,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2193,22,152,99.68,129.33,120.2,N/A,N/A,
68,Jarryd,Lyons,MID,,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2169,22,92,98.59,125,113.8,N/A,Lyons had a good preseason at his new home with a 109 then a huge 147. He doesn't come cheap at $502k but an interesting unique selection for you.,
5,Brad,Crouch,MID,,ADE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2164,22,59,98.36,82.33,89.4,N/A,Crouch had 28 and kicked 2 goals but it was his efficiency which hurt him at 67%. However 91 still a good start for a guy that didn't play last season and was very underpriced. Look for him to build from here.,
361,Tom,Stewart,DEF,,GEE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2160,22,124,98.18,108,98,N/A,N/A,
672,Sebastian,Ross,MID,,STK,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2151,22,126,97.77,123.67,126,N/A,Ross had 27 touches but didn't have any tackles which kept his scoring down. Look for him to improve this week and hopefully return to the scoring we bought him in for.,
786,Andrew,Gaff,MID,,WCE,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,2148,20,134,107.4,120.67,116.2,N/A,N/A,
455,James,Worpel,FWD,MID,HAW,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2135,22,72,97.05,113.67,119.2,N/A,Worpel top scored for the Hawks as he showed that his JLT form was no fluke. His 27 touches resulted in 2 goals and he had the most contested possessions for the Hawks with 12.,
80,Daniel,Rich,DEF,,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2130,22,103,96.82,105,99.4,N/A,N/A,
25,Rory,Laird,DEF,,ADE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2130,22,104,96.82,90,98.4,N/A,Laird had a solid JLT series showing that he hasn't lost any of his scoring power. He will be a popular selection again this year.,
740,Lachie,Hunter,MID,,WBD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,2096,22,97,95.27,110.67,96,N/A,N/A,
466,James,Harmes,MID,,MEL,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,2092,22,95,95.09,90.33,93.2,N/A,N/A,
806,Dom,Sheed,MID,,WCE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Salt&VinegarCripps,,,owner,2091,22,75,95.05,77.67,80.6,N/A,Sheed has had a fantastic start to the season which he has continued into round one. His 38 touches included 10 clearances and 21 of the touches were contested. He is getting the job done in the midfield but it will be interesting to see what happens when Gaff comes back.,
424,Ricky,Henderson,MID,,HAW,N/A,N/A,N/A,Swimming n Titch,,,owner,2086,22,111,94.82,90.33,82.6,N/A,N/A,
82,Mitch,Robinson,FWD,MID,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,2077,22,104,94.41,108.67,111.8,N/A,N/A,
695,Isaac,Heeney,FWD,MID,SYD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,2069,22,54,94.05,82.67,94.4,N/A,Heeney has been a popular selection over the past couple of seasons and he has started this one well with 19 touches at 78% however just 6 of those were kicks which stalled his scoring a bit.,
450,James,Sicily,DEF,,HAW,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,2064,22,124,93.82,103.67,95.6,N/A,Sicily was great with 10 marks and a kick to handball ratio of 22 to 4 which is what we like to see.,
641,Jack,Billings,FWD,,STK,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,2064,22,44,93.82,76.33,79,N/A,Billings didn't get off to a great start but it was better than all but one of his games before the byes last year. His 28 touches were good and he had 4 marks. Importantly his 82% efficiency helped boost that score. Just one Saint went over 100 so don't despair with him just yet.,
222,Dylan,Shiel,MID,,ESS,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2046,21,61,97.43,89.67,99,N/A,Shiel was one of only two Bombers to crack the 100 point mark. He had 25 touches with 18 of them being contested. He was one of few shining lights for the Bombers.,
714,Dane,Rampe,DEF,,SYD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,2041,21,79,97.19,96.33,96,N/A,N/A,
410,Zac,Williams,DEF,,GWS,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,2032,20,100,101.6,100.67,99.2,N/A,Williams didn't play much JLT at all but did manage 82 points in his 53% of JLT1. He was rested in JLT2  and if named he could still be well worth a selection.,
70,Stefan,Martin,RUC,,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,2030,22,85,92.27,103.33,90.8,N/A,Stef had a good return from just 13 touches and 17 hitouts. As an alternative to the big two he scored well. Hopefully he can keep this up and improve from here.,
699,Josh P.,Kennedy,MID,,SYD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2026,19,178,106.63,121.33,109.2,N/A,N/A,
320,Gary,Ablett,MID,,GEE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Salt&VinegarCripps,,,owner,2009,21,167,95.67,121,105,N/A,Ablett was talked up to be more of a forward this season and that is how things panned out. But he did still spend some time in the midfield. 23 touches and 2 goals was a solid game for him but he did give away 3 free kicks.,
614,Bachar,Houli,DEF,,RIC,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,2000,19,110,105.26,119,118.2,N/A,N/A,
618,Dustin,Martin,MID,,RIC,N/A,N/A,N/A,Salt&VinegarCripps,,,owner,2000,20,108,100,126,117.2,N/A,Dusty had 30 touches and half of these were contested. He scored well but did look a bit rusty at times and got caught when normally he would get away. Look for a much better season from Dusty.,
544,Jack,Ziebell,FWD,,NTH,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,1999,22,100,90.86,96.67,96,N/A,N/A,
97,Ed,Curnow,MID,,CAR,N/A,N/A,N/A,Barbeques Treloar,,,owner,1998,22,126,90.82,133,114.6,N/A,Curnow took 12 marks against the Tigers. He also had 25 touches to go with them. He had a good game and was 4th equal top score or the Blues.,
173,Steele,Sidebottom,MID,,COL,N/A,N/A,N/A,DEVQON.1,,,owner,1980,21,0,94.29,99,96.6,N/A,N/A,
73,Hugh,McCluggage,MID,,BRL,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,1975,21,112,94.05,102.67,100.6,N/A,McCluggage hit 114 points from his 20 touches at 85%. Many have suspected that he could score like this and hopefully this is the start of a great season for him.,
6,Matt,Crouch,MID,,ADE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,1970,19,134,103.68,117,109.2,N/A,Crouch was great and had the second best score for the Crows from 40 touches and just under half of them were contested. He is a supercoach machine and well worth being in your side.,
788,Shannon,Hurn,DEF,,WCE,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,1967,19,89,103.53,83,84.2,N/A,Hurn had a great JLT with 111 and 89. Not many people are talking about him and if you want a unique down back he could be your man.,
258,David,Mundy,FWD,MID,FRE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,1959,22,70,89.05,76.33,74.2,N/A,N/A,
145,Jack,Crisp,DEF,,COL,N/A,N/A,N/A,TryingAnewStratton,,,owner,1956,22,92,88.91,80.67,81.4,N/A,N/A,
39,Brodie,Smith,DEF,,ADE,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,1950,22,89,88.64,90,91.2,N/A,Smith was solid for his 81 points from 21 touches. His role may change a little with Doedee out but there is nothing to worry about there.,
312,David,Swallow,MID,,GCS,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,1940,22,71,88.18,96.67,95,N/A,N/A,
696,George,Hewett,MID,,SYD,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,1935,22,79,87.95,76.67,77.4,N/A,N/A,
117,Nic,Newman,DEF,,CAR,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,1933,20,84,96.65,94.67,105.4,N/A,Newman had a lackluster preseason campaign which saw him exit a lot of Supercoach teams. But he turned it on with 21 of his 26 touches by foot as well as 9 marks. He won't change price for another week yet so wait and see how he goes this week before getting him in.,
527,Jared,Polec,MID,,NTH,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,1930,22,118,87.73,90.33,91,N/A,Polec had a good first game for the Roos and finished the day with 27 touches 7 marks and a tackle. If the Roos can get back on track he could improve his scoring from this effort.,
553,Darcy,Byrne-Jones,DEF,,PTA,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,1918,22,97,87.18,71.33,83.4,N/A,N/A,

133,Sam,Walsh,MID,,CAR,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,1912,22,73,86.91,66.33,79.2,N/A,Walsh didn't let down those coaches that paid the extra price for him. 24 possessions and 6 marks on debut certainly paid off. His score could have been higher as only half of his touches were effective but he will only get better which is great for owners.,
675,Jack,Steele,MID,,STK,N/A,N/A,N/A,Man of Steele,,,owner,1900,20,98,95,84.33,99,N/A,Steele was the  best for the Saints and it was the 10 tackles that really helped to go with his 22 touches. He was the only Saint to hit the 100+ mark.,
441,Jaeger,O'Meara,MID,,HAW,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fire The Worpedo,,,owner,1899,21,99,90.43,81,86.8,N/A,O'Meara was great with a couple of goals from his 24 touches and had the second best score for the Hawks. ,

285,Brayden,Fiorini,MID,,GCS,N/A,N/A,N/A,Casting Crouch,,,owner,1845,21,80,87.86,87.67,78.2,N/A,Fiorini is showing the form we all suspected he had and he got there on the back of 30 touches and 6 tackles this gave him the best score for the Suns.,
